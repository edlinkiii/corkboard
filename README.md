Just a project for me to relearn PHP after years of not using it. (It's beginning to look a bit like Twitter.)

### A few of the things I've learned/relearned
* Basic PHP syntax
* OOP PHP
* MVC based on the _TraversyMVC_ Framework
* Authentication
* Sessions
* Access control
* SQL CRUD operations (w/ PDO)
* SQL JOIN statements
